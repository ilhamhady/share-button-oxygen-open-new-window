# Dynamic share button with open link to new window code block for Oxygen

Code block script to create dynamic share button with open to the new window.

This code is an improvement from **Jonathan Jernigan** at [permaslug.com](https://permaslug.com) code, so please give the credit to him ðŸ˜Š

I also added CSS code that will include social icons before the text link using the Dashicons.

I also added a function code that you can add with the code snippet plugin if the Dashicons not showing at the frontend.

Hopefully, this can help you all. ðŸ‘‹
