This code is an improvement from **Jonathan Jernigan** at [permaslug.com](https://permaslug.com), so please give the credit to him too ðŸ˜Š

I added CSS code that will include social icons before the text link using the Dashicons.

I also added a function code that you can add with the code snippet plugin if the Dashicons not showing at the frontend.

Hopefully, this can help you all. ðŸ‘‹
